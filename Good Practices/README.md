## Good habits to have

- Prevent unfinished work
    - Becomes tech debt, harder to implement as project grows
      
- Document chosen coding patterns
    - When project is new, document coding patterns (how data is fetched, how page is rendered)
 
- Review new patterns early
    - Dont write code and introduce patterns through development
    - Discuss with others early when introducing a new pattern
 
- Assume unexpected changes
    - Testing
    - Uncertainty with documentation

# Reviewing PR's like a human

- Use "we" instead of "you" to prevent misunderstanding of tone
- Use passive voice for comments
- Frame feedback as requests instead of commands , allows for open discussion to be made
    - Bad Example : "Remove this function as it is no longer needed."
    - Framed as a request : "Can we remove this function as it is not used elsewhere in the code base?"
- Offer sincere praise for good code
