## Good habits to have

- Prevent unfinished work
    - Becomes tech debt, harder to implement as project grows
      
- Document chosen coding patterns
    - When project is new, document coding patterns (how data is fetched, how page is rendered)
 
- Review new patterns early
    - Dont write code and introduce patterns through development
    - Discuss with others early when introducing a new pattern
 
- Assume unexpected changes
    - Testing
    - Uncertainty with documentation
